📍 Project Overview
This repository contains automated tests developed using Katalon Studio for the Vervane website, a functional platform. The primary objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive quality assurance assessment, as the website currently exhibits multiple critical and non-critical bugs affecting user experience, functionality, and security.

🎯 Scope of Testing
The testing process covered 27 test cases distributed across different categories, namely:

Navigation Testing

Functional Testing

Security Testing

Performance Testing

🔧 Technologies & Tools Used
Katalon Studio – Core framework for test case automation

Android SDK – Used for mobile environment testing

Appium – Enabling mobile and cross-platform testing

Node.js – Supporting cross-platform execution

Data-Driven Testing – Validating inputs across various data sets

Performance Testing Tools – Measuring response time, load, and stress thresholds

Security Tools – For penetration testing simulations

📱 Mobile Testing
Testing was extended to Android devices using:

Android SDK

Appium

Node.js

This allowed us to assess mobile compatibility, user interface responsiveness, and device-specific behavior.

🔐 Security & Penetration Testing
Security assurance is a key focus of this project. We conducted:

XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) simulations

SQL Injection testing

Other penetration testing techniques to uncover vulnerabilities and assess risk exposure

📊 Performance Testing
We also tested the website’s:

Load capacity under traffic

Response time under stress

Reliability during long sessions
